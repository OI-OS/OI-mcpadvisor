# Roadmap: The Future of MCP Advisor

MCP Advisor is evolving from a simple recommendation system to an intelligent agent orchestration platform. Our vision is to create a system that not only recommends the right MCP servers but also learns from interactions and helps agents dynamically plan and execute complex tasks.

### Phase 1: Intelligence Layer (2025 Q2-Q3)

#### Feedback Collection System
- **User Feedback API**: Capture explicit feedback on MCP recommendations
- **Implicit Feedback Tracking**: Monitor which MCPs are actually used after recommendation
- **Success Metrics**: Track task completion rates with recommended MCPs
- **A/B Testing Framework**: Compare different recommendation strategies

#### Agent Interaction Analytics
- **Interaction Logging**: Record detailed agent-MCP interactions
- **Performance Metrics**: Measure response times, success rates, and error frequencies
- **Conversation Analysis**: Extract patterns from agent-MCP conversations
- **Cross-MCP Analytics**: Compare effectiveness across different MCP types

#### Usage Pattern Recognition
- **Task Classification**: Automatically categorize tasks that benefit from specific MCPs
- **Query Intent Analysis**: Identify underlying intent beyond keyword matching
- **Sequential Pattern Mining**: Discover common MCP usage sequences
- **User Profiling**: Build profiles based on MCP usage patterns

### Phase 2: Learning Systems (2025 Q4 - 2026 Q1)

#### Reinforcement Learning Framework
- **State Representation**: Model the agent's context and task requirements
- **Action Space**: Define MCP selection and configuration options
- **Reward Function**: Design multi-objective rewards balancing accuracy, efficiency, and user satisfaction
- **Policy Optimization**: Implement algorithms like PPO or SAC for policy learning

#### Contextual Bandit Implementation
- **Context Extraction**: Identify relevant features from queries and agent state
- **Exploration Strategies**: Balance exploration vs. exploitation with Thompson sampling
- **Online Learning**: Update models in real-time based on interaction outcomes
- **Cold Start Handling**: Strategies for new MCPs with limited usage data

#### Multi-Agent Reward Modeling
- **Collaborative Rewards**: Design reward structures for multi-agent scenarios
- **Preference Learning**: Learn from human preferences between different MCP selections
- **Inverse Reinforcement Learning**: Infer reward functions from expert demonstrations
- **Long-term Value Estimation**: Model delayed rewards for complex task chains

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (2026 Q1-Q2)

#### Task Decomposition Engine
- **Hierarchical Task Analysis**: Break complex tasks into subtasks
- **MCP Capability Matching**: Map subtasks to appropriate MCPs
- **Dependency Tracking**: Manage dependencies between subtasks
- **Parallel Execution Planning**: Identify opportunities for concurrent MCP usage

#### Dynamic Planning System
- **Goal-Oriented Planning**: Generate plans to achieve specific objectives
- **Adaptive Replanning**: Adjust plans based on intermediate results
- **Resource Optimization**: Balance performance vs. cost in MCP selection
- **Uncertainty Handling**: Plan robustly under incomplete information

#### Adaptive MCP Orchestration
- **Workflow Automation**: Create and execute multi-MCP workflows
- **Context Preservation**: Maintain context across MCP transitions
- **Failure Recovery**: Implement fallback strategies for MCP failures
- **Performance Optimization**: Dynamically adjust MCP parameters based on feedback

### Phase 4: Ecosystem Expansion (2026 Q3-Q4)

#### Developer SDK & API
- **Custom Integration API**: Allow developers to integrate their own MCPs
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Provide insights into MCP usage and performance
- **Simulation Environment**: Test MCP orchestration in controlled environments
